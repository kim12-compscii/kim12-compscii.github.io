</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>African Savannah Elephant:</strong> Found in open grasslands.</li>
<li><strong>African Forest Elephant:</strong> Smaller, lives in dense forests.</li>
<li><strong>Asian Elephant:</strong> Found across South and Southeast Asia.</li>
</ul>
<!-- change </li> to </ul> because the list was incorrectly closed with a </li>, which fixes invalid HTML structure -->
